# ReadMe-CheatSheet

My first `README.md`\
Please read the information below if you would like to see how to add content to your `README.md` file while making it look dope\
I have found that if you open both the `README.md` and open a `preview` side by side, it is easier to read along and see what / how to edit your `README.md`

## Heading 1
Use **#** followed by a space and then your title to create a `Heading 1`

* Additionally, H1's have a horizontal line between the heading and the following content

## Heading 2

Size preview for a `Heading 2`

### Heading 3

Size preview for a `Heading 3`

## Additional tips for creating *amazing* README.md files

* Use an asterisk \* to create lists

1. You can also create numbered lists by simply using `1., 2., 3., etc`

You can use a blackslash `\` before an asterisk `*` if you want to show it rather than use it to creat a list\
You can also use a backslash `\` to seperate paragraph lines without a space when placed at the end of a sentence

To `highlight` a word, surround it with backticks (**HINT/HELP**, the backtick is the \` on the tilde `~` key)\
I'm not 100% if this is its true purpose, but it was one of those moments of `my code works and I don't know why` so I'm keeping it as is

    If you tab in once, you get this lovely effect.

```
You can get a similar effect by adding 3 backticks above and below a chunk of text
Please note, these do act / look different outside of preview mode
```

You can add links by using a less than (`<`) directly before the link and closing with greater than (`>`)
